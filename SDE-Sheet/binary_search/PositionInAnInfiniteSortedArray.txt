here we will first find out in which range our key may lie
int search(vector<int> &nums)
{
int low=0;
int high=1;
//we will increase high unless and untill it is greater than key,so that //our key will lie in that range.While moving to the next high ,assign the 
//previous high to the low.

while(nums[high]<key)
{
low=high;
high=high*2;
}
//after finding the search space just perform the BS.
BS(nums,low,high,key);
}
