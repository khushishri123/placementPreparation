Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character target, return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.

Note that the letters wrap around.

For example, if target == 'z' and letters == ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.
Eg:
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "j"
Output: "c"
Code: TC:O(logN)
char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
            int low,high;
            int n=letters.size();
            if(target==letters[n-1])return letters[0];
            low=0;
            high=n-1;
            while(low<=high)
            {
                    int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
                    if(letters[mid]<=target)low=mid+1;
                    else high=mid-1;
            }
            return letters[low%n];
            }
