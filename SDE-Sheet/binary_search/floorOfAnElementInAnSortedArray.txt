given an array and an element.We have to find floor of that element in the given array.
Input: [1,2,4,6,8] ,element=5
Output: 4
Floor of 5 = either 5 is present in array or if not present then greatest number smaller than 5
Ceil of 5=smaller number greater than 5

We will binary search because array is sorted.
if arr[mid]<element then since I have to find find largest one I will shift low =mid+1;
else high=mid-1;

Code:
low=0;
high=n-1;
while(low<=high)
{
mid=low+(high-low)/2;
if(arr[mid]==target)return mid;
if(arr[mid]<target)low=mid+1;
if(arr[mid]>target)high=mid-1;
}
return high;
