Given a string of length N of lowercase alphabet characters. The task is to complete the function countDistinctSubstring(), which returns the count of total number of distinct substrings of this string.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains a string str.

Output:
For each test case in a new line, output will be an integer denoting count of total number of distinct substrings of this string.

User Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function countDistinctSubstring().

Input:
2
ab
ababa

Output:
4
10

Exaplanation:
Testcase 1: For the given string "ab" the total distinct substrings are: "", "a", "b", "ab".

Intuition:

The basic intuition is to generate all the substrings and store them in the trie along with its creation. If a substring already exists in the trie then we can ignore, else we can make an entry and increase the count. Letâ€™s see a detailed explanation.

Approach:

A typical node in a TRIE data structure looks like this:


The 1st step is to create the trie structure and it generally consists of an array of nodes. Since we are going to have only alphabetic characters in the string, the maximum size of the array will be 26. We can also extend to accommodate upper case letters, if we want.
Then, we are going to generate all substrings of the given string. It can be done by 2 nested loops. For each iteration, the outer loop fixes the starting point and the inner loop traverses the substring from the starting point to the end of the string.
For each character encountered in the traversal of the inner loop, we are checking whether that particular node in the trie already contains the character or not. 
If it has, it means that the currently generated substring is a duplicate one. And we can just go to the next iteration to check the next character. But if the current character is not in the current node, then it means that the current substring generated is a brand new one.

And we are creating a new node for the latest character. Since it is a new substring, we are increasing the total count.
Since, the problem also demands to include empty string, we can just add 1(for empty string) to the total counts we got earlier..
Code:

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

struct Node {
  Node * links[26];

  bool containsKey(char ch) {
    return (links[ch - 'a'] != NULL);
  }

  Node * get(char ch) {
    return links[ch - 'a'];
  }

  void put(char ch, Node * node) {
    links[ch - 'a'] = node;
  }
};

int countDistinctSubstrings(string & s) {
  Node * root = new Node();
  int count = 0;
  int n = s.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    Node * node = root;

    for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
      if (!node -> containsKey(s[j])) {
        node -> put(s[j], new Node());
        count++;
      }
      node = node -> get(s[j]);
    }

  }
  return count + 1;
}

int main() {
  string s1 = "ababa";
  cout << "Total number of distinct substrings : " << countDistinctSubstrings(s1);
  cout << "\n";

  string s2 = "ccfdf";
  cout << "Total number of distinct substrings : " << countDistinctSubstrings(s2);

  return 0;
}
Output:

Total number of distinct substrings: 10
Total number of distinct substrings: 14

Time Complexity: O(n2), because we have to go through the entire string for all possible different starting points in order to generate all the substrings.

Space Complexity: O(n2), because in the worst case, all the substrings can be distinct and there will be a node for every substring. Number of substrings of a string of length n is (n * (n + 1) / 2). Hence in the worst case, space complexity will be O(n2).
