Given the root of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.

Return the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not after taking it.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 110
Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
Output: 90
Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)
 

Observation

The easiest way to do this is to check the sum of each subtree and subtract it with total sum of the tree to get sum of both the trees when the current
subtree is removed.

Solution

Let's use 1 DFS to calculate the total sum of the tree and another one to get the sum of the left subtree and the right subtree under the current node which we can use to calculate the answer for every node.

At any given point in the second dfs we can either remove the left subtree under the current node or the right subtree and make either one of them a new tree.
We can thus use the observation above to check all the subtrees in this DFS and formulate the final maximum answer.

For clarity I have here 2 seperate DFS functions, these can be merged into one as in Solution 2.

Complexity
Space: O(h) where h is the height of the tree, at worst this can be O(n) in case of a skewed tree.
Time: O(n). We use two pass DFS's which are O(n) each

Code:
 static int MOD=1e9+7;
class Solution {
public:
long long totalTreeSum=0,result=0;
    void getTotalTreeSum(TreeNode* root)    //Get total sum of the tree.
    {
        if(!root)
            return;
        totalTreeSum+=root->val;
        getTotalTreeSum(root->left);
        getTotalTreeSum(root->right);
    }
    int SumUnder(TreeNode* root)             //Get the totalSum under the node `root` including root.
    {
       if(!root)
            return 0;
       int sumUnderLeft=SumUnder(root->left),sumUnderRight=SumUnder(root->right); //Get the sum of left and right subtree under node 'root'
       result=max({result,(totalTreeSum-sumUnderLeft)*sumUnderLeft,(totalTreeSum-sumUnderRight)*sumUnderRight});    //Get the max product after making left or right subtrees as seprarate tree.
       return sumUnderLeft+sumUnderRight+root->val;
    }
    int maxProduct(TreeNode* root) {
         getTotalTreeSum(root);
        SumUnder(root);
        return result%MOD;
    }
};
