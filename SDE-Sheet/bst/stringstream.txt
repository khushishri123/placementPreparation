stringstream :
A stringstream associates a string object with a stream allowing you to read from the string as if it were a stream (like cin). To use stringstream, we need to include sstream header file. The stringstream class is extremely useful in parsing input. 

Basic methods are:

clear()- To clear the stream.
str()- To get and set string object whose content is present in the stream. 
operator <<- Add a string to the stringstream object. 
operator >>- Read something from the stringstream object.

Examples:

1. Count the number of words in a string

Examples:

Input: Asipu Pawan Kumar
Output: 3

Input: Geeks For Geeks Ide
Output: 4

C++ Program:
#include<sstream>
int countWords(string str)
{
stringstream s(str);
string word;
int count=0;
while(s >> word)
{
count++;
}
return count;
}

2. Print frequencies of individual words in a string

Examples:

Input: Geeks For Geeks Quiz Geeks Quiz Practice Practice
Output: For -> 1
             Geeks -> 3
             Practice -> 2
             Quiz -> 2

Input: Word String Frequency String
Output: Frequency -> 1
              String -> 2
              Word -> 1  

Code in C++:
void printFrequency(string str)
{
stringstream s(str);
map<string,int> m;
string word;
while(s >> word)
{
m[word]++;
}
for(auto it=m.begin();it!=m.end();it++)
{
cout<<it->first<<" "<<it->second<<endl;
}
}
