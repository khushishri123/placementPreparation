getline: The C++ getline() is a standard library function that is used to read a string or a line from an input stream. It is a part of the <string> header. The getline() function extracts characters from the input stream and appends it to the string object until the delimiting character is encountered. While doing so the previously stored value in the string object str will be replaced by the input string if any.
The getline() function can be represented in two ways: 
Syntax: 
istream& getline(istream& is, 
           string& str, char delim);

2. Parameters: 

is: It is an object of istream class and tells the function about the stream from where to read the input from.
str: It is a string object, the input is stored in this object after being read from the stream.
delim: It is the delimitation character which tells the function to stop reading further input after reaching this character.



#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

//macro definitions
#define MAX_NAME_LEN 60 // Maximum len of your name can't be more than 60
#define MAX_ADDRESS_LEN 120 // Maximum len of your address can't be more than 120
#define MAX_ABOUT_LEN 250 // Maximum len of your profession can't be more than 250

int main () {
char y_name[MAX_NAME_LEN], y_address[MAX_ADDRESS_LEN], about_y[MAX_ABOUT_LEN];

cout << "Enter your name: ";
cin.getline (y_name, MAX_NAME_LEN);

cout << "Enter your City: ";
cin.getline (y_address, MAX_ADDRESS_LEN);

cout << "Enter your profession (press $ to complete): ";
cin.getline (about_y, MAX_ABOUT_LEN, '$'); //$ is a delimiter

cout << "\nEntered details are:\n"<<'\n';
cout << "Name: " << y_name << endl;
cout << "Address: " << y_address << endl;
cout << "Profession is: " << about_y << endl;
}

1. Syntax: 
istream& getline (istream& is, string& str);

2. The second declaration is almost the same as that of the first one. The only difference is, the latter have an delimitation character which is by default newline(\n)character.
Parameters: 

// C++ program to demonstrate getline() function

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string str;

	cout << "Please enter your name: \n";
	getline(cin, str);
	cout << "Hello, " << str
		<< " welcome to GfG !\n";

	return 0;
}



Example 2: We can use getline() function to split a sentence on the basis of a character. Letâ€™s look at an example to understand how it can be done.  

// C++ program to understand the use of getline() function

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string S, T;

	getline(cin, S);

	stringstream X(S);

	while (getline(X, T, ' ')) {
		cout << T << endl;
	}

	return 0;
}
