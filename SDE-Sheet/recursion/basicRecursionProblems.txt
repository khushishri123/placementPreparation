Recursion:
When a function call itself untill a special condition is met.
** TC to print fibonacci series via recursion is O(2^N).
1.) Print 1 to N but through backtrack.
->Through backtrack means while calling recursive function we are not allowed to call it by doing i+1.
If we have to simply print numbers from 1 to N through recursion then we can do so by calling rec. function as f(i+1,N) and the base condition will be if(i>N)return.
But here we have to do that through backtrack.
So code will we like this:(Remeber that you are allowed to do i-1 but you are not allowed to do i+1)

Code:

int f(int i,int n)
{
if(i<1)return;
f(i-1,n);
print(i);
}
int main()
{
int n=5;
f(n,n);
return 0;
}
