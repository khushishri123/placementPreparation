When do we use recursion?
When we have to count all possible ways or when we have to find the best out of all possible ways ,then we use recursion.

Shortcut to find recursion:
1) Try to represent the problem in terms of index.
2) Do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement
3) If you have to count all ways ,then do sum of all the stuffs
4) if you have to find min,then find min of all stuffs .Similarly for max.

If I am writing a recursion then it should give all possible ways to reach at that index.
TC:O(N);
SC:O(N)
int climbStairs(int n) {
        int f[n+2];
        f[0]=1;
        f[1]=1;
        int i;
        for(i=2;i<=n;i++)
        {
            f[i]=f[i-1]+f[i-2];
        }
        return f[n];
    }
