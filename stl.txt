STL: Standard template library
STL is set of C++ TEMPLATE CLASSES to provide programming DS and functions such as vector, lists,stack, etc.

To sort a array:  sort(a,a+n)
To sort a vector:  sort(vec.begin(),vec.end())

1.) Pair
-> Pair is used to combine two values that may be of different type.
-> declared in <utility>
-> pair<int,char> p;
   p.first=10;
   p.second='A';
-> pair g2(g1) //to copy  
-> g2={10,'a'}; //another way to initialize

2.) Vector
-> Vector are dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself when a record is inserted or deleted.
-> While declaring vector,we did not have to specify size .
-> Inserting at the end takes differential time, as sometimes there may be a need of extending the array. 
-> Removing the last element takes only constant time because no resizing happens. 
-> Inserting and erasing at the beginning or in the middle is linear in time.
-> vector<int> vec;
vec.push_back(10);
or vec[i]=10;
//for iterating
for(auto it=vec.begin();it!=vec.end();it++)cout<<*it<<endl;

-> front() – Returns a reference to the first element in the vector
   back() – Returns a reference to the last element in the vector
   pop_back()- used to pop or remove elements from the back .
   insert()- vector_name.insert (position, val)
   eg: vec.insert(vec.begin()+2,10); 
   erase()- myvector.erase(iterator1, iterator2);

-> 2D vector
vector< vector<int> > vect{{1, 2},{3, 4, 5},{6}};
